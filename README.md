# Hello, I'm Ankita

I am a Python developer with a strong interest in automation, web scraping, and building efficient, real-world solutions through code.

Currently, I am focused on:
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Developing simple web applications using Flask

As a freelancer and continuous learner, I enjoy creating tools that simplify complex tasks and improve productivity.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/) for collaborations, freelance opportunities, or just to share ideas.
